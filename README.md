#### About Game

Whimp is a mischievous thief who stole something he shouldn't have this time: The Hourglass of Death! 

Now, he needs to escape Death before his time runs out. Use the powers of the hourglass to evade death!


##  ðŸ“” Summary Of The Game:
Death is chasing you; evade ostacles by jumping or crouching. Speed up time when Death approaches to widen the gap between you. If the time is short, slow it down to gain time, but remember, slowing time or hitting an obstacle may allow Death to catch up with you! You can also dash or fire by spending time. Dashing allows you to phase through obstacles and shooting the crystals destroys them, rewarding you some extra time. Use your time wisely! If your time runs out, the chase ends.

* S - Crouch
* A - Speed Up Time
